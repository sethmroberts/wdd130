        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home Page/About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Seth Roberts and I am a current student at BYUI. I have been coding for almost a year now, 
        but I am very passionate about it and am very excited for my future in this career world. I am a very fast learner, 
        and I love to work out problems in my head all the time. Planning out new programs is very fun. While my toolset is 
        limited to only a few languages right now, I am still ensuring to lock down the basics and utilize them however I can.</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
        <p>Outside of coding I love to jump into many hobbies! I love skiing and the outdoors. I will always jump on a 
        chance to take my hammock up the canyon and hang out with family or friends with a campfire. I was very passionate 
        about filmmaking in high school and was in various competitions with my teams. I learned how to use Photoshop, 
        Premiere Pro, After Effects, Lightroom, Illustrator, and a few other programs. One of my passions is learning 
        new programs. I have dipped my toes into Unity, Blender, Godot, Revit, and I am very fluent with AutoCad. </p>
        
        <p>I grew up designing homes with my dad's company and have put my name on a wide range of projects from cabins 
        to poolhouses, home additions, custom homes, and detached garages. I love to design and it is likely a skill I 
        will carry with me through life.</p>
        
        <p>I love my family! There is nothing that makes me more happy than my family, and I love to spend time hanging 
        out with them and playing games or spending time outside.</p>
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>I have worked a couple of jobs that I think are important to note. Starting with my career in residential drafting 
        and design, I grew up working with my dad since I was 14. I learned AutoCad when I was even younger, but as I grew 
        older I began to take on real projects. When I turned 14, I began to design real plans. I became fluent with AutoCad 
        and specifically became very interested in how creating “dynamic blocks” could speed up the design process. </p>
        
        <p>I found new tools to help my dad's business in the field measuring aspects as well as by outlining processes 
        in the field and creating organized Excel sheets for tracking expenses, incomes, and time spent on different phases 
        of projects in order to give more accurate bids.</p>
        
        <p>In two different summers I have done summer sales jobs. Going out and knocking on doors with a sales pitch to 
        get sales was not something I would have expected myself to do when I was younger. The time I spent memorizing 
        pitches and fine-tuning my body language skills has been invaluable to me. I learned confidence, resilience, 
        and how to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. I learned accountability. A lot of your success depended 
        upon how well you could shape your mindset, and how well you prepared yourself and trained.</p>
        
        <p>At Walgreens Pharmacy I was a pharmacy technician. It was here that I first realized my love for learning. This 
        was a very fast-paced environment and I felt a lot was expected of me right from the start. I had to memorize a 
        huge list of drugs with different strengths and effects, I had to learn a new program for writing and deciphering 
        prescriptions, and I had to memorize many different systems that insurances would use. Memorizing the insurances 
        was likely one of the more difficult parts.</p>
        
        <p>It seemed that you could never just guess what problems insurances would have with different drugs or prescriptions; 
        it was problem by problem. I actively threw myself in front of the customers more than I needed to because I wanted 
        to feel confident in my space. I knew this would only come through failure after failure. The more times a prescription 
        had a problem, the more solutions I could become familiar with.</p>
        
        <p>I quickly grew in my position and came to the point where people who had worked for months were asking me for help 
        in only my third week there. It was through this experience that I learned an active learning environment engages 
        me very strongly, and that was what piqued my interest in code.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>Currently, I am working on a Chrome extension to make the Canvas calendar system easier to read. I have difficulty 
        in school trying to organize all of my classes, and so does my peer. Together we have started to create an extension 
        that will have an easy-to-use calendar with more features offered than just the base calendar.</p>
