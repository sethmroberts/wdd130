          <p>Currently, I am working on a Chrome extension to make the Canvas calendar system easier to read. 
            I have difficulty in school trying to organize all of my classes, and so does my peer. Together we 
            have started to create an extension that will have an easy-to-use calendar with more features 
            offered than just the base calendar.</p>

          <p>This website is a personal project I've been building to share my work and practice my front-end skills. 
            I wanted a space that feels like me, with some fun features like an interactive cow and a flip-card resume. 
            It's still evolving as I learn more and try new ideas.</p>

          <p>I've got a few ideas in the works that I'm really excited aboutâ€”this space is just waiting to be filled. 
            Stay tuned for something new as I continue exploring and building!</p>
