            <h2>Unnamed Browser Extension</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am working on a Chrome extension to make the Canvas calendar system easier to read. 
              I have difficulty in school trying to organize all of my classes, and so does my peer. Together we 
              have started to create an extension that will have an easy-to-use calendar with more features 
              offered than just the base calendar.</p>

            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <p>This website is a personal project I've been building to share my work and practice my front-end skills. 
              I wanted a space that feels like me, with some fun features like an interactive cow and a flip-card resume. 
              It's still evolving as I learn more and try new ideas.</p>

            <h2>MossBeats</h2>
            <p>MossBeats is a little project I built to analyze a playlist of songs using the Spotify API. It reads a list 
              of songs from a file, then grabs their BPMs, and builds a BPM curve showing the range. Eventually, 
              I want it to organize songs into a smoother flow based on tempoâ€”kind of like a smart playlist shuffler that 
              makes transitions feel more natural.</p>
